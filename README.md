## The nearest object localization through 3D lidar reconstruction using an embedded system

This work was presented in the XXVII Electrical and Electronics journey of Escuela Politécnica Nacional.

## Abstract

This work presents the design and implementation of a portable system that allows detecting the nearest object’s location through 3D reconstruction using a stereoscopic camera. The system transforms the environment information in front of the camera to a tridimensional point cloud that is filtered digitally in order to determine the nearest object spatial localization. The whole processing is performed in an embedded system which is powered by a lithium-polymer power bank. All devices are placed in a vest to be worn by the user. The vest gives improvements in weight, portability as well as autonomy and comfort. Remote graphical interface visualization is used as a way to verify the correct work of the system and also it is capable to observe the reconstructed environment, the nearest object and its localization respect to the user.
